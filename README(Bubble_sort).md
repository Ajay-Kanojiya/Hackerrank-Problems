# Problem3 --> Sorting: Bubble Sort
  Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

  1. Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwap is the number of swaps that took place.
  2. First Element: firstElement, where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
  3. Last Element: lastElement, where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
  
  Hint: To complete this challenge, you must add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

  For example, given a worst-case but small array to sort:a=[6,4,1] we go through the following steps:

      swap    a       
      0       [6,4,1]
      1       [4,6,1]
      2       [4,1,6]
      3       [1,4,6]
It took 3 swaps to sort the array. Output would be

    Array is sorted in 3 swaps.  
    First Element: 1  
    Last Element: 6
